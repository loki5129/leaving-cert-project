    <div> 
       based on the graph and counts of different types and according to the table of super and restitances type below
       the ideal team would have super effictive coverage on all 18 types however this is not possible as some types onlt cover 1 and other cover larger ampunts
       a atype of a grass, posion ground rock, ghost and fairy. this covers all tpyes expect for fire types. however if you want the only one left to be 
      flying as this would be the statistically best screanio  this team would not be albe to hit  2 tpyes not jsut one. i reccomend according to the data that the 
      team that has the highest number of types covered is the ideal team to use.
      <br>
      the mean of amount of primary types in trainer is 1600.22 this number is due to having a large disparety in data.
      the mode common type is water with 5723 pokemon used by trainers, this is probaly due to the larger number of water trainers found in most games.
      the range is 5723 this is a very large range since there are only 9 pokemon in total that have flying as a primary type and most of these are in newer generation that are not in the dataset.

      
      <br>   
      the range of levels is at a almost the max that it can be at has the limit of pokemon levels is 1 and 100 with the max of my data being 98 instead of the max possile 99.
      the mean of levels is 40.44 this is slightly skewed to the lower end.
      the mode is exaclty 50 which is half of teh max possible level of pokemons. 
      
      <br>
      based on the mean of the data used for the histogram you can expect their to be more pokemon in eariler parts of the games as the mean level is 40 and their very 
      few that are higher than level 70. i reccomend based on the data that grinding pokemon up to or beyond level 70 will make the game easier as most trainer wil have 
      pokemon wihtn the 50-60 bracket
      <br>
      improvements that could be done to the dataset would be to update it has it was made 8 years ago and is missing 11 core series games
      this newer generation use more of the fairy types as fairy was only include in 6 of the games in this dataset.
      another improvement that could be made is the includion of the gym leaders that the dataset is missing. 
      these improvements would increse the size of the dataset thus increasing the accuratness of the dataset.
