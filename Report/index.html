<h1> Investigation</h1>
 <p>
my first idea was to make a project using the different types of energy used for electrically in Ireland. The second idea i came up with was to use 
a Pokémon dataset to find the base stat total and find which type had the highest mean value. third idea which is the one I went with is to use a 
dataset containing Pokémon trainers and their Pokémon and find out the most common types and average level of Pokémon. I found this dataset on Kaggle
<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>.I started by researching Pokémon levels I found an article on bulbapedia<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>I found out that Pokémon levels have a range of 1 to 100. 
I then researched similar project I found someone who had made a similar project found this on reddit<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>, this project was similar  but it was
only one game and was the frequency of Pokémon in trainers.I researched Pokémon types, I learned that there are 20 types in the Pokémon games<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup> 
two of these types are not in the data because they are only used in the latest game, and the dataset was created 8 years ago.I researched what data was in the data set.
 What games were included in the data shown in fig.1, The ones in it are green and those in red are not in the data.To make this table I found a unique trainer in the game from a walkthrough on bulbapedia<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup> 
 and cross checked it to see if it was in the data.This data also includes rematches that can be done after defeating a trainer the first time<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>.
 I also discovered that it does not include gym leader<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup>,rivals<sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup>,elite four<sup><a href="#9">[9]</a></sup> and champions<sup><a href="#10">[10]</a></sup>. rivals are not included because their teams are 
dependent on what starter<sup><a href="#11">[11]</a></sup> you pick.</p>

<h1 > Plan and Design (approximately 400 words) </h1>

	<p> i started by researching how to clean and search the data i decided on using the pandas read_csv and pop to read and remove colums that i dont need from the csv.<sup><a href="#12">[12]</a></sup>then using the write_to_csv function to make a clean csv file to use.<sup><a href="#13">[13]</a></sup>
    i tried using the csv module's dict writer<sup><a href="#14">[14]</a></sup> but that did not fit the data i was working with.i then reasearched dictonaries<sup><a href="#15">[15][16][17][18][19][20]</a></sup> to learn how they work so that i could use them for the type counts.
    i then made the frist draft of the flowchart of the code. i reasearched ploting librarys at frist i was going to use matplotlib<sup><a href="#21">[21]</a></sup> but i then found out about ploty<sup><a href="#22">[22]</a></sup> and decided to use it beacuse it has a appeling ui and build in interactivly.
    i spent a long time reasearching how to make a grpah in ploty using the graph_object libary<sup><a href="#23">[23]</a></sup> i decided to use this beacause it can make figures and make dropdown menus. i decided to make a histogram<sup><a href="#24">[24]</a></sup> on the levels 
	of the pokemon and a bar chart<sup><a href="#25">[25]</a></sup> for the types. i will use the ploty graph_object libary to make a dropdownmeunu<sup><a href="#26">[26]</a></sup> for the graphs so that it can swap between them. this will use trace graphs<sup><a href="#27">[27]</a></sup>
	and making one visible and invisble depaneding on the stat of the dropdown bar. i the reasearched javascpirt and making forms<sup><a href="#28"></a></sup> i deiced to use localstorage<sup><a href="#29">[29]</a></sup> to make the database for my form. 
	i will be using visual studio code with the python exstention. i will use github to store the project<sup><a href="#30">[30]</a></sup><br>
	i used the pylance module mangener to get modules for python. the modules i will use are:

	<p> 
	<!----i start by import all the module i will need for the project, pandas for reading and cleaning the csv. plotly_graph objects for making the graphs and jinja2 for the template function to place the export graphs into javascpirt. i started by using pandas's read_csv function to read the csv so it can be edited in python.
	i then used pandas pop to remove all the columns that i did not need, after each column is remove i printed the data to test if the data removed is correctly. then i wrote this cleaned data into a new csv using the write_to_csv function and named it clean_data.csv. i then used 
	the read function agian to read the clean data.i then used pandas's data_to_dict function to turn the data into what i thought would be a ditonary but it was just a list with each row of the csv as an element in the list. i still used this because it worked for a test loop.
	i then made a dictonary for each type of pokemon and set the value to 0 and a null list for levels of the pokemon and extracted the keys of the dict. i then used a for loop to loop through each elenment in the list of the data inside there a nested for loop that loops
	through each key of the dictonary and checks if the key is in the element of the list if it is it adds 1 to the value of the key.this is done until it reachs the end of both loops. then i made a function to return the level an element of the list. this dunction took in the string.
	turned it into a string to esure that it works.i then used the built in lower function to ensure that the later cleaning works. then i used the re fucntion to remove brackets from the string.i then used the re module to split the string into a list spliting it at each comma. 
    then i removed the first 2 element for the list and the last element. i turned the list back in a string using the built function. then "pokelevel" is removed from the string and used the re sub function to remove brackets. and re replace to remove commas. then used the int 
	function to turn the string into a int and return that value. after each step in cleaning i placed a print statment to ensure all the steps worked correctly. i then made a for loop in the range of the number of elements in the list that uses the clean function to get the level 
	and then appends it into the empty level list. i then defined each colour in hex in a list i got this colour for the image shown in fig.5  i used microsoft paints colour picker tool to get the hexcode and used that as the colour. i then created two empty list for the x and y of the bar chart called bar_chart_y and bar_chart_x.
	i then made a for loop that loops for each key in the types dictonary. for each key it appends the key to bar_chart_x and appends the value of the dictonary for the key into the bar_chart_y list. the bar chart is then created using the the Bar fucntion with the x as the bar_chart_x list and y as the bar_chart_y list and the colour as the colour list
	and gave it an black outline. i then used the histogram fucntion form ploty graph_object to make a histogram with the level_list as the x and use the histnorm as probility density and the distance between the x labels as 10 and gave it a black outline.
	i then used the ploty graph_object function figure to create a figure called fig and then using the add_trace function to add the bar and the histogram as traces to the figure and then used the ploty graph_objects function update traces to set the histogram visble to fasle and set the defualt visible as the bar chart.
	i then used the ploty graph_objects update_layout to update the menu to create a dropdown menu that for each button makes the other graph invisble and makes the graph corresponding to the button visible and adds the corresponding title and axis labels. i then defined the config to remove the logo and remove all the buttons on the bar that i was not using.-->

one of the problems that i encountered when making this project was getting the graph from the python code to the javascpirt code. the frist idea i haad to fix this problem was to try and use flask after looking into flask i diecded
not to use it has it was new to me and seemed uneccesary for what i need to do. the second idea was to use the build in function in plotly to export an intreactive graph, after looking at the documation for this built in function, learned  that you can use jinja2 to 
place it inside a html file in a aspefic place.i tryed this and it worked to get the graph onto the webpage but when trying to view the html code for the webpage it would crash my text editor. so to fixed this i reread the documation amd found that
adding conditions to the builtin function can limit its size i removed it incluing the entirity of the plotjs and mathjax libarys and link them as script files on the top of the template file  i also set full_html to fasle so that it only sends the 
where the grpah goes and the script for the graph. when i looked at what had been outputed was a a div with an unique id and the graph on a single line in a scprit tag after looking at this i had the idea to put the graph code that is inside the 
scprit tag into a javascpirt fie and the div with the id to a html file and link the javascpirt to the html. to do this i used the string method to get the section of the output that is the div with the id and place it in the html file using the jinja2 template function.
and then using the same string method i took the section that contains the graph and removed the parts that are inconpatable with javascpirt and places it in a javascpirt file using the same jinja2 template function. with these step up the graph shows cleanly 
and can be easily viewed and debuged.</div>

an algohrim that i used in this project was to extract the level from each index of the list of dictonaries like data. this was do by taking in the each index of the list turning it into a string and using various 
re methods to remove section of the string until all that is left is the level for that index and that is then converted to a integer and retrun and then is append to a list of all the levels. this is done by putting the 
function inside a for loop so it runs for every index of the list and then appends it to a list. the psedueo code is in the image below labeled fig.3. </div>
