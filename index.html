<h1> Investigation (approximately 400 words) </h1>
my frsit idea was to make a project using the different types of enregy used for electricly in ireland and graph tham over time, i decided againist this idea because i wanted something that was more instering to me and i wanted to use a dataset with more data.
 the second idea i came up with was to use a pokemon dataset to find the base stat total and find which type had the highest mean value and then plot 
 spefic stats and highest mean value in the tpyes of pokemon. ,y thirid idea which is sthe one i when with is to use a dataset containing pokemon 
 traniers and their pokemon and find out the most common types and average level of pokemon that appear in said trainer dataset. i found this dataset 
 on kaggle.
