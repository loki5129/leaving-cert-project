<h1> Investigation (approximately 400 words) </h1>
 <p>my frsit idea was to make a project using the different types of enregy used for electricly in ireland and graph tham over time, i decided againist 
 this idea because i wanted something that was more instering to me and i wanted to use a dataset with more data.
 the second idea i came up with was to use a pokemon dataset to find the base stat total and find which type had the highest mean value and then plot 
 spefic stats and highest mean value in the tpyes of pokemon.thirid idea which is sthe one i when with is to use a dataset containing pokemon 
 traniers and their pokemon and find out the most common types and average level of pokemon that appear in said trainer dataset. i found this dataset 
 on kaggle.i started by reasearching pokemon levels i found a article on bulbapedia<sup>[1]</sup>
 i found out that pokemon levels have a range of 1 to 100 using this i planned the project to use this data for a histogram. this also serves as a good test that if i see a 0 in the graph i know that 
 that something has gone wrong and i need to rexemaie the code. i then researed similar project i found someone who has made a similar project i found this on reddit<sup>[2]</sup>
 i then reasearched pokemon

   (b)i cleaned the dataset being turning it from a sqlite file into a useable csv
 2.
  (a)i carried out analytics by calcuting mean and standrad devetaion and turn them into 2 graphs using plotly
  (b) i ensured to label my axis according ot the data shown.
