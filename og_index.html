<h1> Investigation (approximately 400 words) </h1>
 <p>my frsit idea was to make a project using the different types of enregy used for electricly in ireland and graph tham over time, i decided againist 
 this idea because i wanted something that was more instering to me and i wanted to use a dataset with more data.
 the second idea i came up with was to use a pokemon dataset to find the base stat total and find which type had the highest mean value and then plot 
 spefic stats and highest mean value in the tpyes of pokemon.thirid idea which is sthe one i when with is to use a dataset containing pokemon 
 traniers and their pokemon and find out the most common types and average level of pokemon that appear in said trainer dataset. i found this dataset 
 on kaggle<sup>[2]</sup>.i started by reasearching pokemon levels i found a article on bulbapedia<sup>[1]</sup>
 i found out that pokemon levels have a range of 1 to 100 using this i planned the project to use this data for a histogram. this also serves as a good test that if i see a 0 in the graph i know that 
 that something has gone wrong and i need to rexemaie the code. i then researed similar project i found someone who has made a similar project i found this on reddit<sup>[3]</sup>, this project was a 
 simallar projext but only spaned 3 generations of pokemon and was the most common pokemon and not the most the common type or distribtion of levels.
 i reasearched pokemon types, i learned that there are 20 types in the pokemon world<sup>[4]</sup> two of these tpyes are not presence in the data due to the fact that
 they are only used in the lasted game and the dataset was created 8 years ago. with these 18 i plan on making an algrithom to find how many of each type and making them 
 into a bar chart. 
 i researched what data was in the data set i relaised that i didnt need the majorty of the data. i found that the data set cotained all the main games in generation 1 - 6 inclluding pokemon colosseum,
 pokemon xd and excluding pokemon stadium both the japanese and the international version, pokemon emerald, the battle frontier in pokemon platlium. this list aslo includes rematchs that can be done 
 after defeatting a trainer the frist time<sup>[5]</sup> note this can only in be done in games form geneartaion 3 and on.

 <h2> meeting basic requiments</h2>

 1. 
   (a)i collected a dataset from kaggle.
   (b)i cleaned the dataset being turning it from a sqlite file into a useable csv
 2.
  (a)i carried out analytics by calcuting mean and standrad devetaion and turn them into 2 graphs using plotly
  (b) i ensured to label my axis according ot the data shown.
  (c) i used list and dictonaries to store my data
 3. 
  (a) i made a website using html, css and javascpirt.
  (b)the graphs are shown
